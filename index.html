                        The AE86 series of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota
                        Sprinter Trueno are small, front-engine/rear-wheel-drive
                        models within the front-engine/front-wheel-drive fifth
                        generation Corolla (E80) range — marketed by Toyota from
                        1983 to 1987 in coupé and liftback configurations.
                    </p>

                        Lending themselves to racing, the cars were light,
                        affordable, easily modifiable and combined a five-speed
                        manual transmission, optional limited slip differential,
                        MacPherson strut front suspension, high revving (7800
                        rpm), twin-cam engine with oil cooler (e.g., in the US),
                        near 50/50 front/rear weight balance, and importantly, a
                        front-engine/rear-drive layout — at a time when this
                        configuration was waning industry-wide.

                    <p>
                        Widely popular for Showroom Stock, Group A, and Group N,
                        Rally and Club racing, the cars' inherent qualities also
                        earned the AE86 an early and enduring international
                        prominence in the motorsport discipline of drifting. The
                        AE86 was featured centrally in the popular, long-running
                        Japanese manga and anime series titled Initial D
                        (1995-2013) — as the main character's drift and tofu
                        delivery car. In 2015, Road & Track called the AE86 "a
                        cult icon, inextricably interwoven with the earliest
                        days of drifting."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The AE86 would go on to inspire the Toyota 86
                        (2012-present), a 2+2 sports car jointly developed by
                        Toyota and Subaru, manufactured by Subaru — and marketed
                        also as the Toyota GT86, Toyota FT86, Scion FR-S and
                        Subaru BRZ.

                    <p>
                        In November 2021, Toyota temporarily restarted the
                        production of a limited number of parts for the AE86,
                        and dealers began taking orders for new steering knuckle
                        arms and rear brake calipers. Rear axle half shafts have
                        also been scheduled for new production. Toyota also
                        announced that this reboot is temporary, and parts will
                        be available only as long as stocks last.

                    <p>
                        The nameplate <i>Trueno</i> derives from the Spanish
                        word for <i>thunder</i>, and <i>Levin</i> derives from
                        the Middle English for <i>lightning</i>. In Japan, the
                        Sprinter Trueno was exclusive to Toyota Japan
                        dealerships called Toyota Auto Store, while the Corolla
                        Levin was exclusive to <i>Toyota Corolla Store.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The name <i>AE86</i> derives from Toyota's internal code
                        during the car's development, designating the 1600 cc
                        RWD model from the fifth generation of the Corolla. In
                        Toyota's code language, the "A" designates the car's
                        engine (4A series), "E" designates Corolla, "8"
                        designates fifth generation (E80 series) and "6"
                        designates the variant within this generation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The AE86 is also called the "Hachi-Roku (ハチロク)",
                        Japanese for "eight-six". Similarly the AE85 was
                        commonly called "Hachi-Go (ハチゴー)", meaning
                        "eight-five". Bracketing a minor external facelift,
                        models marketed between 1983 and 1985 are called "zenki"
                        (前期, lit. early period), and those marketed from 1986
                        to 1987 are called "kouki" (後期, lit. latter period).
                        In 1986, Toyota marketed a limited edition model of the
                        AE86 as the "Black Limited" model.

                        The AE86 was available with a fuel injected naturally
                        aspirated 4A-GE Inline-four engine DOHC 4 valves per
                        cylinder 1,587 cc (1.6 L; 96.8 cu in) in Japan and
                        Europe, which was also used in the first-generation MR2
                        G Limited (AW11), Celica 1600GT-R (AA63) and Carina
                        1600GT (AA63) (Japan only) with a compression ratio of
                        9.4:1, had a maximum SAE gross power output of 130 PS
                        (128 hp; 96 kW) at 6,600 rpm and 110 lb⋅ft (149 N⋅m) at
                        5,200 rpm of torque in standard form, though it was
                        later down-rated to 120 PS (118 hp; 88 kW) and 105 lb⋅ft
                        (142 N⋅m) in net output. The AE86 came with a 5-speed
                        manual gearbox, and later came with the option of an
                        automatic. The 4A-GE engines used in the AE86 and AW11
                        were equipped with Toyota Variable Intake System
                        (T-VIS). The AE86 had an optional LSD.

                        In North America, a modified 4A-GEC engine was used to
                        comply with California emissions regulations. Power was
                        rated at 112 hp (114 PS; 84 kW) and 136 N⋅m (100 lb⋅ft)
                        of torque. The AE86 used ventilated disc brakes. The car
                        was equipped with a MacPherson strut style independent
                        suspension at the front and a four-link live axle with
                        coil springs for the rear as well as stabilizer bars,
                        front and rear.

                    <p>
                        Higher-spec AE86 models known as the Sport GT-S featured
                        the DOHC 4A-GE, 4 wheel disc brakes, color matched
                        bumpers, front lower bumper surround had a much more
                        sporty and pronounced lip, door panels were molded,
                        tachometer redline is around 7,500, wrapped steering
                        wheel, seats had leather wrapped tops (front seats are
                        completely different from Sport SR5), optional LSD, and
                        aluminium wheels, chassis code in the VIN is AE88 (for
                        North American market cars).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lower-spec American AE86 SR5 models used the 1,587 cc
                        (1.6 L) 4A-C SOHC unit, The SR5 rear end was a non LSD
                        with drum brakes. The SR5 model also had a softer
                        suspension, and small styling and interior changes such
                        as seats, gauge cluster, door panels, un-painted front
                        and rear bumpers, and the lower part of the front bumper
                        surround is shorter and flat, and its chassis code in
                        the vin differs as well being AE86 for the SR5 model
                        (for North American market cars).

                    <p>
                        Models equipped with the 4A-GE engine received a 6.7 in
                        (170 mm) rear differential, while 4A-U, and 4A-C models
                        received a smaller, weaker, 6.38 in (162 mm) rear
                        differential. The AE86 SR5 (4A-C equipped) had an
                        optional automatic transmission, though the GT-S model
                        (with the 4A-GE DOHC engine) only came with a standard
                        5-speed manual gearbox. One of the staff who was behind
                        the car's engineering work was Nobuaki Katayama, who
                        would later head the company's motorsport department and
                        who would become chief engineer of the Altezza project a
                        decade later. He has a photo of an AE86 hung in his
                        office.
